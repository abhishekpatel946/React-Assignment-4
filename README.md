# Getting Started with Create React App

For today’s task, you’ll be creating a simple form.

This form will take the following inputs from User:


Name 

Email

DateOfBirth

Gender (Radio Button)

Profile Pic

Level of Education(Select options)

Password

Confirm Password

 

At the click of a Submit button, perform validations on user input. If there is an error, then display the error message otherwise console log the user data.


As you did yesterday, raise a PR and get it reviewed.
